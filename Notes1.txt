list of values? - each element in the list will be given as input to the operation

   filter
           it takes each input and it will pass the variable to a conditional expression
		   if the result of the conditional expression is true, the input will be intact or it ll be removed
		   
		   list= [34,35,331,534,533,134]
		   result=filter((x)=>x%2==0)
		   result will be [34,534,134]
		   
		   no of input elements >= number of output elements
   
   map
   
         it takes each input and it will generate a new value by processing the input
		 
		 list=['Ram','ravi','Raj','Rakesh']
		 result map(x=>x.toUppercase())
		 result will be ["RAVI","RAJ","RAKESH"]
		 
		 number of input elements = number of output elements
   reduce
   
        it takes each input and process it and every time the previous result is 
		passed for next iteration and finally one result is produced
		
		list =[1,3,6,9,10]
		result = reduce( (x,y)=> x+y )
		how it works?
		
		iteration 1 -> 1,3 => 1+3 => 4
		iteration 2 -> 4,6 => 4+6 => 10
		iteration 3 => 10,9 => 19
		iteration 4 => 19,10 => 29
