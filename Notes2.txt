Map Reduce

Collection ? - list of documents

list of documents -> map ?

 map would process each document and would emit required properties/fields in general two properties
 to processed by reduce
 
 reduce would take the input from map and process it
 and finally come up with a result
 
 the result would be stored in new collection
 
 
 collection -> map - > reduce -> new collection
 
 mapReduce(mapfunction,reducefunction,{colletioname})
